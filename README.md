# Advent of Code - Sveltekit

I wanted to try out Sveltekit, and I wanted some way to easily create and track
my code for the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>
site.  Thus this repo was born.  I started on StackBlitz, but I just couldn't get
over how bad the file tree works.   I can never tell what directory a file is
in because the file is indented more than two levels past directories.
